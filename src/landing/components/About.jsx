            Back in 2009, I started just with Corel Draw exploring what design
            means creating for my self my first designs. I had the privilige of
            start studying Computer engineering and tumbled head first into
            coding and development but it was not until 2020 that I built my
            first webpage withÂ <span className="font-bold text-color_primary">HTML, CSSÂ andÂ Javascript.</span>

          I become a <span className="font-bold text-color_primary">FrontEnd Web developer</span> and coding has become my passion the last years. I love seeing the results of my efforts. I really enjoy learning and exploring technologies. I also try to increase my creative skills by learning aboutÂ designÂ too.
